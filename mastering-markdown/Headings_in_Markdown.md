There are two ways to do headings in markdown.

Best ways is to simply use hashes in front of the line.

**Example:**
```
# One hash is for H1
```
_Output:_
# One hash is for H1

**Example:**
```
## Two hashes is for H2
```
_Output:_
## Two hashes is for H2

**Example:**
```
### Three hashes is for H3
```
_Output:_
### Three hashes is for H3

**Example:**
```
#### Four hashes is for H4
```
_Output:_
#### Four hashes is for H4

**Example:**
```
##### Five hashes is for H5
```
_Output:_
##### Five hashes is for H5

**Example:**
```
###### Six hashes is for H6
```
_Output:_
###### Six hashes is for H6

# Second way:

Another way to make headings is to put === below a line for H1 & --- below a line for H2
**Example:**
```
This is Heading 1
===
```
_Output:_

This is Heading 1
===

**Example:**
```
This is Heading 2
---
```
_Output:_

This is Heading 2
---
