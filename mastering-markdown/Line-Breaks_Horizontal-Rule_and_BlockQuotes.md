## Line Breaks

We can use <br> tag to break the line (remember, one blank line inbetween the two lines makes it a paragraph automatically)

**Example:**

```
This is on line 1 <br>
And this is after line break.
```

_Output:_

This is on line 1 <br>
And this is after line break.


## Horizontal Rules

To make a Horizontal Rules, use three dashes ("-") or equal ("=") sign together to create a Horizontal Rule. But remember to leave a blank line between the text and the symbol else it will be recognized as H1 or H2 (as we've seen earlier)

**Example:**

```
This is a line of text with a horizontal rule below.

---

Another line with another ----------

===

```

_Output:_

This is a line of text with a horizontal rule below.

---

Another line with another ----------

===


## Block Quotes

If you wanna quote someone, based on when you're replying to someone on a forum or you've a website where you want to put some quote then you need to append the line(s) with ">"

**Example:**

```
> You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. -Wayne Gretzky
>
> Another line here

```

_Output:_

> You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. -Wayne Gretzky
>
> Another line here
