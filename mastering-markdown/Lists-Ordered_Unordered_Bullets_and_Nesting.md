# Lists

## Unordered lists

Simply put an asterisk (*) in front of each line to make a bulleted list. We can also use a dash(-) or plus (+) sign and it will give the same result

**Example:**
```
Ingredients
+ milk
+ eggs
+ sugar
```

_Output:_

Ingredients
+ milk
+ eggs
+ sugar

## Ordered Lists

Simply put a 1. in front of each line to make it an incremental list. No need to put an incremental number at all!

**Example:**
```
1. Combine Ingredients
1. Gently Stir Together
1. Bake at 350 for 20 minutes
```

_Output:_

1. Combine Ingredients
1. Gently Stir Together
1. Bake at 350 for 20 minutes

## Nesting

You can indent using a hard tab or two (or three) spaces to make an indented list.

**Example:**
```
1. Combine Ingredients
    * Sift the flower

    This is inline (nested)

    ```

1. Bake at 350 for 20 minutes
```
