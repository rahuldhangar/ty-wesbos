# Paragraphs

In Markdown, there should be a full line space between two paragraphs to visually in order to become a paragraph element.

This is para one.

This is Para two.

# Bold, Italic & Strikethrough

We have two ways to do Bold & Italic in Markdown.

If we wrap a word in single * then it becomes *italic* and if we wrap it in double ** then it becomes **bold**

Similarly, a single _ wrap makes the sentence or word _italic_ and wrapping a sentence in double __ makes it __bold__

So, one set of asterix or underscore makes a text _italic_
and two sets of asterix or underscores makes a text **bold**

For ~~strikethrough~~, simply wrap the content in stw sets of tilde symbol (~)
